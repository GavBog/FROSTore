## Introduction
**FROSTore is a tool to prevent your Private Key from being compromised and used to sign data without your permission.**

FROSTore allows you to use Ed25519 threshold signatures to bring distributed trust to your application. Keys generated by FROSTore are never combined into a single key, and are never stored on any single device. This means that even if a device is compromised, your private key is still safe.

## Features
- [x] Create, store, and manage threshold signatures
- [x] Sign data with threshold signatures
- [x] Distributed Key Generation (DKG)
- [x] Customizable Minimum and Maximum thresholds

## Examples
We have provided a few examples to help you get started. You can find them in the [`/examples/`](examples) directory.

For more information on how to use FROSTore, please check our [docs](https://docs.rs/frostore).

## Research
FROSTore is primarily based on the following research papers:
- [Two-Round Threshold Schnorr Signatures with FROST](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/)
- [FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf)

## Disclaimers
This is a work in progress and is in **BETA**. It is not ready for production use.
